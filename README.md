A calculator designed for The Odin Project

## how it works
You use your mouse to enter values and operators. It is possible to continue the calculation after evaluation. If you don't press an operator then you start over.
If you want to clear you have to press 'c' twice.
You can't divide with zero. If you do, you get a message and a one instead
